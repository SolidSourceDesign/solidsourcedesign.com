Web development is all about one thing: getting your site to perform the tasks you want it to as seamlessly as possible for as many users as possible. Quality development can offer an excellent return on dollars invested. Just imagine, even a simple online order form can save dozens our hours for a company by automating a task that would otherwise have to be performed by an actual person. And, as more and more people prefer to use computer systems to take care of day-to-day tasks, well-developed tools built into your website can substantially increase your overall sales by appealing to an emerging market.

            <h1>Backend administration systems</h1>
			<p>For clients whose needs can be met by widely supported open source systems such as WordPress and Magento, we can configure those systems to maximize ease of use and provide education to ensure that you'll be able to get your website to perform for you in regular changes and updates. Clients who need a more custom-fit solution can have individualized administration systems built driven by technologies in the SQL family.</p>

            <h1>Cross-browser, cross-device support</h1>
			<p>Our websites are designed to function and display well for as many visitors as possible. Regardless of whether a visitor is using Apple's or PC's, desktop computers or mobile devices, Safari, Chrome, or Firefox, your site will display as consistently as possible. Since even lower-quality browsers such as Internet Explorer still hold significant market shares, it's very important to make sure that the variations that different platforms can introduce to your site are accounted for.</p>

            <h1>Forms, plugins, and widgets</h1>
			<p>Modern websites can have numerous features, from contact forms to Twitter feeds, order forms to custom utilities. We'll help you choose the best features to include in your site based on knowledge of programming best practices and visitor appeal. We know all too well that visitors have high standards for these features and we do everything we can to make sure that the visitor's use of them is as frictionless as possible.</p>

            <h1>Reliable techniques</h1>
			<p>We believe that websites should function reliably for as many users as possible. That means that bleeding-edge technologies that put unusually high demands on servers, such as server-generated web pages, or browsers, such as recently released aspects of CSS3 and HTML5, should be avoided. While we embrace new technology at the point that it's widely accepted as functional by the web development community, we avoid the pitfall of trying to use the newest technology just because it makes the finest effects a little easier.</p>
