            <h2>Website</h2>
			<p>This client needed a complex website that served a variety of functions for their company. The site we constructed for them was not only a great success in its aesthetic features, capturing the calm, homey feeling that the client was looking for, but also in the custom-built features included: utilities for taking customer orders, sending confirmation and billing emails, accepting customer correspondence, and processing job applications from their candidates.</p>

            <h2>Repair and reface</h2>
			<p>This site, originally built from an underdeveloped WordPress template, was cramped by oversized graphics that didn't match the open atmosphere of Juno Studio and didn't say enough about its spirit. We gave a newer, fresher look to its homepage and repaired key functions, namely the contact form which was only actually delivering messages to the salon owner about 50% of the time.</p>

            <h2>Animated advertisements</h2>
			<p>This newspaper was seeking a competent graphic design company to produce a group of animated advertisements for one of its clients. The ads were intended to be placed in the newspaper's online version. When they were received by the online editor, the newspaper decided that they added so much to the site that they ran the ads for an extra twelve weeks totally free to the original client.</p>

            <h2>Site expansion and refinement</h2>
			<p>As this company had matured, its site needed to be updated to support the growing needs of the company. Due to the rollout of a new way of purchasing the product offered on this site and increased needs to regularly update the site's content, we custom-built two entirely new sections including a new contact form, multiple new animation effects, and the seamless addition of a WordPress administration system within the already existing site architecture.</p>

            <h1>Voice Dialogue Connection, LLC</h1>
            <h2>Landing page and WordPress management</h2>
			<p>Changes in marketing strategy required this site to include a new landing page for a product that was going to be included in a Pay-Per-Click ad campaign. It also needed numerous updates to be performed through the WordPress interface to keep the site up-to-date with the activity of the company. We were able to work from the original design of the website to produce work that was immediately pleasing to the client.</p>
