            <h1>Features</h1>
			<p>As the World Wide Web has developed, it's become clear that websites are not only excellent marketing tools but incredibly powerful business tools as well. Websites can help to keep track of multiple customer relationships simultaneously, help you get in contact with them and respond to their needs, or even help you prepare them for the work you'll do with them. Any good design should take into account features like these and find the right ways to integrate them into your site.</p>
